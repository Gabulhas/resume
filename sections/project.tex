\subtext{Compiler and Language Design Class}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Language Design, Parsing, Lexing, Assembly code generation
\item OCaml language, OCamllex, OCaml Menhir, X86\_ Assembly

\subsection {{Research on Distributed Algorithms}\hfill 2021}
\subtext{Bachelor's Thesis}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Distributed Systems, Distributed Data Structures, Mutual Exclusiion, Concurrency
\item Go Language
\item Studied the original ``Arrow Distributed Directory Protocol'' and developed a implementation of a node in Go, to test the algorithm in a distributed setting. Implemented a visualization of the state of the network (and the distributed data structures), and Ownership/Requesting/Arrival events history.
\end{zitemize}
